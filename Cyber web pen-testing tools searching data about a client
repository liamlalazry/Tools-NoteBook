Voilanorbert.com
Clearbit.com  => connect => only available in chrome !
For email validate if exist = https://verifalia.com/validate-email
Role 1: do not underestimate forget password a forgot password page can give a key letter even after the dots for example li******@g**** can be cruisial to comparing the data with data we already have !
Rule 2: Using leaks databases to get more data after getting the email or other data 
Example database dehashed.com
Crt.sh => a website to web certificate that out there in the internet but founds also emails and subDomains

Nikto = scanner for vulnerability in the network ! gets a url in the terminal checks the network with that url
Dirbuster = directory buster, 
(Gobuster,dirbuster alternatives and makes the same idea )
dirbuster has a wordlist of wellknown directories in the url and it checks them with the website it can help as get into pages that we wouldn’t got into alone for example it will search for as the word admin and it will check for the files we tell him to check for for example pdf zip docx etc…
Then we can browse into those directories and dig some knowkege and search for vulnerability 
Smb- a file share the client using very vulnerable commonly used In workings spaces.

Metasploit = platform to check the vull – of anything like smb and more it kind of a database of vulenrabilitys tht can be used and exploit if triggered 
-trying to connect to the file share as said earlier smb is a file share system with smbclient we will try to connect to the share -l say list the file and then give the ip u of the machine with the smb u trying to connect to  if we lucky maybe the smb not protected with password and we would be able to get in to see the info
Ssh-trying to connect to the network with ssh connection using the terminal ssh +ipv4 + params
In the ssh search we looking for a banner with info about the ssh connection and staff
Googling exploits for the vulnerables we find already for example googling exploit for smb unix sanba2.2.1 then finding scripts in exploit database and github etc  then using the scripts againt the vulnerable 
Searchsploit-as the name says it search for sploits it takes u as a string so don’t be too specified it the equivqlent to the google search for exploit
